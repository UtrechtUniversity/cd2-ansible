# CD² ansible playbook 

Ansible playbook for the deployment of the CD² metadata catalogue.

## Requirements

### Requirements for local development (Docker setup)

* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
* The images have been developed for the amd64 architecture

### Requirements for deploying to server

* [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html) (>= 2.9)
* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/) (2.x - only for local VM)
* Enterprise Linux 9 (e.g. AlmaLinux or RHEL)
* The images have been developed for the amd64 architecture

## Local development in containers (Docker)

If you use Windows, ensure that core.autocrlf is set to false in your git client before you clone the CD2 catalog
repository: _git config --global core.autocrlf false_ Otherwise the Docker images may not work due to line
ending changes.

### Building the images

If you want to test any local updates, you need to re-build the images:

```
cd docker
./build-local-images.sh
```

### Running the application using Docker

First add an entry to your `/etc/hosts` file (or equivalent) so that queries for the development setup
interface resolve to your loopback interface. For example:

```
127.0.0.1 cd2.ckan
```

Unless you want to build the images locally (see above), you need to pull them from the registry:

```
cd docker
docker compose pull
```

Then start the Docker Compose setup:
```
docker compose up
```

Then wait until CKAN has started. This may take a couple of minutes. Navigate to
https://cd2.ckan in your browser. The development VM runs with
self-signed certificates, so you'll need to accept the security warning in your browser.

## Local development VM

First create the VMs using Vagrant:

```bash
vagrant up
```

On a Windows host, first SSH into the Ansible controller virtual machine (skip this step on GNU/Linux or macOS):
```bash
vagrant ssh cd2-controller
cd ~/cd2-ansible
```

Deploy CD2 catalog to development virtual machine:
```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

Add the following host to /etc/hosts (GNU/Linux or macOS) or %SystemRoot%\System32\drivers\etc\hosts (Windows):
```
192.168.60.30 cd2.ckan
```
